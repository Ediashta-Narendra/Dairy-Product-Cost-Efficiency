    <h1>Supermarket Cost Efficiency Analysis</h1>
    <p>
        This project focuses on improving supermarket cost efficiency by evaluating the least performed dairy products, measured by their inventory turnover ratio. 
        Towards the SMART framework, the goal is to increase the company's profits through cost efficiency, optimizing refrigerator usage for storing dairy products, 
        and achieving a 10% cost reduction in the first quarter after implementing the efficiency decision.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem Breakdown </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How much is the monthly average of storage costs for dairy products during 2022â€“2023? Are there specific periods where patterns can be identified?</li>
        <li>How much is the total average cost for each product? Does it align with the average revenue for each product? Which products have high costs but low revenue?</li>
        <li>How much is the turnover ratio for each product? Can it indicate unprofitable products?</li>
        <li>How do suppliers compare for the least profitable products in 2022 and 2023?</li>
        <li>Are products with the lowest turnover ratio caused by high prices?</li>
        <li>Is there a relationship between the product categories to be evaluated and their farm or supplier?</li>
    </ul>
